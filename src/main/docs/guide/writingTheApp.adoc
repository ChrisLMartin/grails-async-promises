____
Added Grails 2.3 and since 3.3 an external project, the Async features of Grails aim to simplify concurrent programming within the framework and include the concept of Promises and a unified event model.

Your project already contains the async dependency:
[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/build.gradle[tag=async]
